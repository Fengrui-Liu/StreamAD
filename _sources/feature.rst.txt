Why StreamAD
=============


Purpose & Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StreamAD focuses on streaming settings, where data features evolve and distributions change over time. To prevent the failure of static models, StreamAD can correct its model as needed.

Incremental & Continual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StreamAD loads static datasets to a stream generator and feed a single observation at a time to any model in StreamAD. Therefore it can be used to simulate real-time applications and process streaming data.


Models & Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StreamAD collects open source implementations and reproduce state-of-the-art papers. Thus, it can also be used as an benchmark for academic.


Efficient & Scalability:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StreamAD concerns about the running time, resources usage and usability of different models. It is implemented by python and you can design your own algorithms and run with StreamAD.



Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`StreamAD` is distributed under `BSD License 3.0 <https://github.com/Fengrui-Liu/StreamAD/master/LICENSE>`_ and favors FOSS principles.
